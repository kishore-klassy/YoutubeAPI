Certainly! Below is a simple template for a README file with instructions to run the server and test the API:

```markdown
# YouTube API Project

This project provides an API to fetch the latest YouTube videos based on a predefined search query. The project is built with Django and Django REST framework.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Django
- Django REST framework

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kishore-klassy/YoutubeAPI.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd YoutubeAPI
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On Linux/Mac:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Run migrations to set up the database:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

## Run the Server

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Fetch Latest YouTube Videos

To continuously fetch the latest YouTube videos in the background:

```bash
python manage.py crontab add
```

This sets up a cron job to run every 10 minutes (adjustable in `FetchVideosJob` class).

## Test the API

You can test the API by making GET requests. For example:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/videos/
```

## Stop the Server

To stop the development server, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

## Deactivate Virtual Environment

When you're done, deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

```

Feel free to customize the instructions based on the specifics of your project. If there are additional steps or configurations needed, make sure to include them in the README file.
